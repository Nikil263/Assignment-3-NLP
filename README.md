# Assignment-3-NLP

In this assignment, the evaluation of lexical semantics and vector semantics is presented. The evaluation is based on the golden standard Simlex-999 and two large corpora of different genre, namely brown and gutenberg available in nltk libraries. The vector semantic methods used are TF-IDF and Word2Vec. The evaluation metric used is nDCG using pytrec-eval. The results are presented in the form of bar graph.
